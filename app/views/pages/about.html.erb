  <h2>Our History</h2>
  <p>After collaborating for six years across various projects in the UK, Dorin, Nicolae, and Nabil recognized a significant gap in the resourcing and construction industry. They observed a lack of meaningful relationships between operatives and agencies, leading to inefficiencies and subpar project outcomes.<br> <br>

Driven by their shared vision and work ethic, they founded DNNovation, pooling together 36 years of collective industry expertise. Their mission? To revolutionize the industry by prioritizing quality and fostering genuine connections with operatives.<br> <br>

DNNovation implemented a unique program focused on developing tight-knit operative teams. By investing in comprehensive briefings, proper equipment, and individual rapport, they cultivated a community of trust and excellence on every project.<br> <br>

The results spoke for themselves. Small, dedicated operative teams consistently outperformed larger, less cohesive groups. Exceptional client feedback reinforced their approach, cementing DNNovation as a premier resourcing solution synonymous with smooth, safe, and high-quality project delivery.<br> <br> </p>
